  title: Coverage Spec
  description: |
    This is a spec that is used to measure steps coverage against it.
    It purposely does not contain anything inside each path item.
    It is meant to be used alongside coverage_steps.yml.
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /covered_path: {}
  /uncovered_path: {}
  # Steps will include an undocumented path
  /nested/path: {}
  /doubly/nested/path: {}
  /path/{with}/braces: {}
components: {}
